# Pose_Tracker_Live
Exercise Tracker with Repetition Counting and Performance Analysis This project is a Flask-based web application that utilizes MediaPipe Pose to track exercises in real time.
I have implemented posture intactness feature it will check that the exercise is only performed within a correct posture and then and only then it will count the reps it is only implemented for Hammer curl and triceps_pull_down. In the correct posture keep your wrists near your shoulder and it will check posture intact as True and then perform the exercise.
